## Description

I made a web application with React JS and Flask for the api-rest, I used mongodb to save the information. In this web application you can play guess the flag, there are a total of 3 game modes among them we have normal, hard and hardcore mode. In each of them will appear 5 flags and depending on the game mode will have more or less time. In game modes with a higher difficulty the points multiplier will be higher, because every time you guess a flag you add points. In each game mode there is a ranking and there is also a global ranking of players that is governed by the amount of points they score.
